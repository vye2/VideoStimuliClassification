# VideoStimuliClassification
Visual stimuli from 5 categories of videos (abstract, waterfalls, faces, Rube Goldberg mechanisms, and speed) were shown to 17 subjects, resulting in different brain wave patterns collected by an electroencephalogram (EEG) test. Our goal is to train a neural network, to identify what category the subject was looking at, based on the EEG data.
